# What is this ?

This is basically an attempt to fully emulate the 8080 emulator, from top to bottom.

This is learning project not an utility to be used by others.

This is a crude, first project type shit(So kindly judge me as harshly as possible but objectively and calmly, so that I can gain experience from this project).

Comments are aprreciated and are encouraged.

Many parts are not implemented.

# How to run this project ?

Like any CLI utility make the project and input the 8080 binary to execute it.(Should run on any platform with c compiler)

```console
./emulate8080 binaryname
```

# For contributors 

### There are two way to start implementing opcodes :

1. By running the program on the provided binary 'invaders_game'. It will output the instruction in the binary which is not implemented.

2. Or by going into the project and finding which opcodes are yet to be implemented.
